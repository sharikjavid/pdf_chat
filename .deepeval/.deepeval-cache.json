Two instances are similar when they end up in the same logical segment. In this section, we consider models that define similarity by considering the geometry of the instance space. In Geometric models, features could be described as points in two dimensions (x- and y-axis) or a three-dimensional space (x, y, and z). Even when features are not\\n\\n4\\n\\nintrinsically geometric, they could be modelled in a geometric manner (for example, temperature as a function of time can be modelled in two axes). In geometric models, there are two ways we could impose similarity.\\n\\nWe could use geometric concepts like lines or planes to segment (classify) the instance space. These are called Linear models.\\n\\nAlternatively, we can use the geometric notion of distance to represent similarity. In this case, if two points are close together, they have similar values for features and thus can be classed as similar. We call such models as Distance-based models.\\n\\nLinear models\\n\\nLinear models are relatively simple. In this case, the function is represented as a linear combination of its inputs. Thus, if x1 and x2 are two scalars or vectors of the same dimension and a and b are arbitrary scalars, then ax1 + bx2 represents a linear combination of x1 and x2. In the simplest case where f(x) represents a straight line, we have an equation of the form f (x) = mx + c where c represents the intercept and m represents the slope.\\n\\n10) 9 S 0 1 2 3 a 5 b 4\\n\\nLinear models are parametric, which means that they have a \\ufb01xed form with a small number of numeric parameters that need to be learned from data. For example, in f (x) = mx + c, m and c are the parameters that we are trying to learn from the data. This technique is different from tree or rule models, where the structure of the model (e.g., which features to use in the tree, and where) is not \\ufb01xed in advance.\\n\\nLinear models are stable, i.e., small variations in the training data have only a limited impact on the learned model. In contrast, tree models tend to vary more with the training data, as the choice of a different split at the root of the tree typically means that the rest of the tree is different as well. As a result of having relatively few parameters, Linear models have low variance and high bias. This implies that Linear models are less likely to overfit the training data than some other models. However, they are more likely to underfit. For example, if we want to learn the boundaries between countries based on labelled data, then linear models are not likely to give a good approximation.\"]}": {"cached_metrics_data": [{"metric_data": {"name": "Correctness (vs Expected) (GEval)", "threshold": 0.5, "success": true, "score": 0.7558189518059109, "reason": "The Actual Output provides additional details on how geometric models define similarity, which enhances the understanding beyond the Expected Output.", "strictMode": false, "evaluationModel": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "evaluationCost": 0, "verboseLogs": "Criteria:\nNone \n \nEvaluation Steps:\n[\n    \"Examine the 'Actual Output' and the 'Expected Output'.\",\n    \"Determine if the 'Actual Output' is factually consistent with the 'Expected Output'.\",\n    \"Assess if the 'Actual Output' omits any critical information from, or introduces any inaccuracies not present in, the 'Expected Output'.\",\n    \"The score should reflect the degree of factual alignment and completeness of the 'Actual Output' in relation to the 'Expected Output'.\"\n]"}, "metric_configuration": {"threshold": 0.5, "evaluation_model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "strict_mode": false, "include_reason": false, "evaluation_steps": ["Examine the 'Actual Output' and the 'Expected Output'.", "Determine if the 'Actual Output' is factually consistent with the 'Expected Output'.", "Assess if the 'Actual Output' omits any critical information from, or introduces any inaccuracies not present in, the 'Expected Output'.", "The score should reflect the degree of factual alignment and completeness of the 'Actual Output' in relation to the 'Expected Output'."], "evaluation_params": ["expected_output", "actual_output"]}}, {"metric_data": {"name": "Faithfulness", "threshold": 0.7, "success": true, "score": 1.0, "reason": "Great job!
